# broadband_affordability
This rep includes the script in R to create a dataframe with information on income per decile of population and to calculate broadband affordability.

The information is loaded from the World Bank's API, plus two different files: the Information Society table from the World Development Indicators, available at: http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/5.12 and income and region classification of countries, available at: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS
I am adding these files to the repo. Path to the files need to be updated when running the script.

The R script includes a more detailed description.
